        <h4>Encounter Me is a community based, trail walking game where different factions fight for the control of specific capture points.</h4>

        <h3 style="margin-top: 6%">Capture points</h3>
        <h5>Capture points are marked on map, most of them being place of interest, e.g. park, sculpture, fountain.</h5>

        <h3 style="margin-top: 6%">Interaction with capture points</h3>
        <h5>Capture points can be <b>attacked</b>, <b>reinforced</b> or <b>captured</b> by walking a randomly generated trail.</h5>
        <h5>Same faction capture points can be reinforced, enemy ones can be attacked. Attacking <i>reduces</i>, reinforcing <i>increases</i> capture point defense level by one.</h5>
        <h5>Once capture point defense level reaches 0 it can be captured by any faction.</h5>

        <h3 style="margin-top: 6%">Trail walking</h3>
        <h5>Trail length depends on capture point's defense level, the higher the level - the longer trail will be generated.</h5>
